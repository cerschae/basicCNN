This is a modified version for the official Keras CNN Cifar10 example found here 
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/cifar10_cnn.py

I've rendered the network more robust to gain an adequate 90% efficiency adding batch 
normalisation, a few more layers and giving the user the capability of modifying the
learning rate. It's an extremely basic example destined as a starting point for CNN
projects.

Usage information can be found in the initial comment of the script.

Glory to tensorflow :P

Hope its helpful,

cheers,
